1) Obtain the sphere grid as and output for us to view it (clear)

2) Moving a single point over the sphere (clear)
->Given a time t tell me where my point is on the sphere
->You are given initial conditions i.e. starting pos and vel on sphere.

3) Moving multiple points over the sphere (extension of (2)) 

4)Creating a circle on the sphere

5)Moving a whole circle on the sphere

6)Changing size of circle as it moves 

7)Coming up with a good growth rule (hard)

8)Checking overlap of circles

9)Coming up with collision rules for circles (hard)

10)Writing the Billiard Collision Algo for a flat surface to understand its performance (can reference from CP project)

11)Moving the algo to the sphere

12)(Optional) Imaging the circles
